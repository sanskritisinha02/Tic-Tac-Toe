# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe, also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
